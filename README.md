# nml-db_thinclient
Client side NeuroML-DB
https://github.com/scrook/neuroml-db/

neuroml-db contains some great mutlicompartment NEURON, and Allen processing pipelines, however the implementation is server side, 
and dependency heavy.

This repository serves as a light weight client side implementation of those pipelines and algorithms.
